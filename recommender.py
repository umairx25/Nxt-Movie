    Takes in a list of movie objects that the user has favourited, the list of all possible movie objects from the

    For each movie in favs, it creates a list of similar movies from given dataframe whose Movie objects are
    then added to a weighted graph as nodes.

    The weights between every pair of movies are calculated using the algorithm implmented in
    calculate_similarity. The Pagerank algorithm is then used to calculate the importance of each movie based on the
    weights of all its edges. A list of names of movies with the highest importance are returned.
